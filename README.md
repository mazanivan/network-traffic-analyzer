- Option to save clean output and statistics  
- Protocol summary at the end

---

## 📦 Quick Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/network-traffic-analyzer.git
cd network-traffic-analyzer
```

### 2. Install dependencies

If you're using Debian/Ubuntu with Python 3.12+:

```bash
pip install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ⚠️ Important

Scapy must be installed for the **same user who runs the script**.  
If you install it as a normal user but run the script with `sudo`, it won’t work.

✅ To avoid this issue, use `sudo -E` when running the script. This preserves your environment and Python packages:

```bash
sudo -E python3 nta.py
```

> ❌ Do **not** use just `sudo python3 nta.py` – it will likely result in:  
> `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scapy'`

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
sudo -E python3 nta.py
```

You will be guided through:

- Network interface selection  
- Capture limits  
- Optional filtering  
- Option to save output and protocol statistics
